## Folder structure

* There are prepared several basic folders such as 'Models' and 'Prefabs', comonly used for projects in Unity editor. 

* Git is set to ignore content of '_NonVersioned' folder - so you can freely put there anything that shloud not be tracked by by Git (like working versions of 3D models, textures, ...).
